        <p>Save the bees! This illustration graphic of a bumblebee in a tribal style was designed in a fictitious collaboration with a local charity to be created into stickers and printed on apparel to raise awareness and to build funds to preserve the bumblebee. This is meant to be a cool graphic tailored towards nature enthusiasts passionate about saving bumblebees and other pollinators. It is intended to be sold in local downtown gift shops, museums, welcome centers, and an online shop.</p>
