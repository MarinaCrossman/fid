        <p>The idea for this wild joker card came together from the concept that we are all pawns within the game of chess called life; with the insightful power of our third eye, we can make moves toward becoming something more, just like how a pawn in the game of chess can become a queen. Combining this concept of a third-eye pawn with a joker playing card adds another layer to the design as jokers are generally considered wild cards. Created using Adobe Illustrator this Joker card is tailored towards people who have a love for playing cards and collectors of all things wild with a deeper meaning. The typeface used: Myriad Pro.</p>
