        <p>This whimsical illustration, created in Adobe Illustrator, began as a simple brief to design a robot. As a nature lover, I was initially hesitant to create something purely mechanical, so I embraced my creative freedom to merge technology with the organic world. My goal was to harmonize two contrasting elements—nature and machinery—into a single, cohesive design. The concept started with the idea of a birdcage as the robot's torso, housing delicate gears alongside living birds. From there, her form took shape, incorporating flowing, curvilinear lines that softened her mechanical structure and gave her a gentle, feminine presence. She is constructed from oxidized copper, gold, and stainless steel, allowing her to feel both aged and timeless. I have named her Patina, a reflection of how nature leaves its mark on even the most industrial creations.</p>
